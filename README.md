- You can present the powerpoint to your group and film it or just make a little movie of your project

- Show the team number all the time in the video!

- Upload it to the google drive [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QEy5b0DMtrkyUZ2MnAOehZ40S1QbvAi_?usp=sharing) until Sunday May 4, 2025  October 7 - 14:00 (UTC/GMT +2 hours - Time zone in Vienna)

- I will need group 1 first and group 91 last (2pm deadline for group 1)

- I will copy all the video to my computer and I will start them

- I will promote you all to the panel and please activate your microphone and camera when your video is playing

- The jury will ask you a question, just answer

- For hosts it would be great if you can just use one computer for all the presenters answering the questions.

- Make sure that your zoom name is visible correctly (just use rename)
